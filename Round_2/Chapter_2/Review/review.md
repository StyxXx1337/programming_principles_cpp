# Review Chapter 2

### 1. What is the purpose of the _"Hello, World!"_ programm?
> The purpose is to make the most simplest program that displays something. This program is useful to test your environment and play around with the compiler to show how it reacts on different errors.
### 2. Name four parts of a function.
> 1. Return Type
> 2. Function Name
> 3. Function Arguments
> 4. Function Body
### 3. Name a function that must apper in **every** C++ program.
> The `main` function must appear in every C++ program. It is the entry point for the code.
### 4. In the _"Hello, World!"_ program, what is the purpose of the line `return 0;`?
> It is used in some OS to state that the program finished without error.
### 5. What is the purpose of the compiler?
> The compiler translates the source code to machine code, that is understandable for the machine.
### 6. What is the purpose of the `#include` directive?
> The `#include` directive imports other code from different files, so that it can be used in the current file.
### 7. What does a `.h` suffix at the end of a file signify in C++?
> The `.h` stands for a header file or header. It is mainly used to be `#included` into other C++ programs.
### 8. What does the linker do for your program?
> The linker likes different programs together, so that the files can be compiled separatly. The linker links these compiled files to a create an executable.
### 9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
> A source file contains the code you write. It is not undertandable for a machine. Also source files are not machine specific. Object files contain machine code and are machine specific. Meaning they can't be transfered to an other machine and be executed.
### 10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
> IDE stands for `Interactive Development Environmnet`. It simplifies many tasks to just one button-click.
### 11. If you understand everything in the text book, why is it necessary to practice?
> Practice is necessary to automate the concepts and to train the understanding while solving problems.
